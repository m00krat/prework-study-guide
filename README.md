# Michael's Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a practice site in which I can come back to study, while during my time at the Uconn Coding bootcamp. 
This website should allow me to log what I learn and also help me when I get stuck. I believe it will be a great refrence to look back on while completing my bootcamp assignments. Not only is it helpful as a reference, it has also allowed me to get acquainted with a few programming languages I've never learned before, such as CSS and Javascript. I believe it has warmed me up and prepared me for the next 6 months of bootcamp.
